R Programming / Domain Research and Exploratory Data Analysis

In this task we are asked to analyze the Individual household electric power consumption data set.

Data Frame:
Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

Attribute Information:
1.date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy 
2.time: time in format hh:mm:ss 
3.global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) 
4.global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) 
5.voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) 
6.global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) 
7.sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). 
It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). 
8.sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). 
It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. 
9.sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). 
It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

Version 1 is about obtaining the data by sql query and date/time treatment
Version 2 is about exploring the original data that can be acquired from UCI Machine Learning Rep.
Version 3 is about preparing a clean data for visualization
Version 4 is about data visualization and exploratory data analyses
